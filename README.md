<!-- ### Continuous Integration

- The configured workflow will check the types for each push and PR.
- The configured workflow will check the code style for each push and PR.
- **Automatic tests**

### Publishing

- Each time you push changes to the `main` branch, the [`release`](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow starts, which creates a new draft release. For each next commit will be created and replaced artifacts. That way you will always have draft with latest artifacts, and the release can be published once it is ready. 
  - Code signing supported. See [`release` workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).
  - **Auto-update is supported**. After the release is published, all client applications will download the new version
  and install updates silently.

> This template **configured only for GitHub public repository**, but electron-builder also supports other update distribution servers. Find more in [electron-builder docs](https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish). -->
